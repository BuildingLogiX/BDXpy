`bdxpy` is a Python package designed to interface with BuildingLogiX Data Exchange (BDX), a building analytics platform developed by BuildingLogiX.📊

## Key Features
- **Access BDX trends and analytics:** Enables access to building information, trended data, equipment scores and energy analytics.
- **Handles BDX authentication:** Hides the complexity of BDX authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Provides data in native format:** Data series retrieved from BDX are available in Pandas DataFrame format, which enables intuitive processing in Python.

Get started with [installation instructions](getting-started.md).

## Summary Overview and Concepts
This package allows users to interact with an API hosted on a BDX site. BDXpy is a Python library designed to facilitate interaction with BuildingLogiX's API for managing building data, trends, components, and hierarchies. This guide provides an overview of the library's features, including how to authenticate, retrieve data, and handle exceptions. It includes modules for authentication, session management, trend data retrieval, and component lookup.
Our goals with BDXpy are:

- 🔥 Allow a *new canvas of opportunities for partners* – almost endless with python and package features.
- 🚀*Quicker development ideas with examples from partners* and internal BLX teams🚀
- More “power” or experimentation on the end user.✔️
- Take advantage of Open-Source capabilities and help 💡*define what the future of FDD and Optimization could become at a lower cost*.💡
- 👍 Promote more advanced *Machine Learning and Energy savings outcomes* and grow the industry.
- ✨✨Create a *library/standard of advanced visualization and analysis available to the greater community*.✨✨
