# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I install BDXpy?
Use pip:
```bash
pip install bdxpy
```
See the [installation section](https://buildinglogix.github.io/BDXpy/getting-started/#installation).

## How do use BDXpy?
See our workflow diagram for getting started: [workflow bdxpy](https://buildinglogix.github.io/BDXpy/getting-started/#process-overview-from-bdx-to-bdxpy-and-python-outputs).

## Do I have to pay for BDXpy?
BDXpy requires an active BDX license including the license feature for RemoteAPI.
Installation of the Python package BDXpy is free and publicly available as well as all documentation and some basic examples to get users started.

## What if I don't know Python?
Python is one of the most widely used [programming languages](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/) and is open-source. It has many resources, classes, examples online beginners can pull from.
Likewise most AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. all generally quite good a Python development and we highly encourage beginners to utilize all these available tools.  

BuildingLogiX is also working on forming a dedicated BDXpy custom GPT, coming soon.....

## What are IDEs, which one should I use for BDXpy?
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides coding tools, such as syntax highlighting, debugging, and auto-completion, to make development easier.

For working with BDXpy, most of our team uses VS Code most of the time or Jupyter Notebook in VS Code. There are others we also recommend depending on your experience and preference:

- **VS Code** â€“ Lightweight, customizable, and great for Python development.
- **PyCharm** â€“ More feature-rich, with advanced debugging and code analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Best for interactive data analysis and quick visualizations.
- **Spyder** â€“ Designed for data science, similar to MATLAB.  

ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: If you need a full-fledged Python IDE, VS Code or PyCharm is great. If you are doing data exploration, try Jupyter Notebook.

## What is the difference between Python and Jupyter Notebook files?
- **Python scripts (.py):**
    - Standard Python files used for writing and executing programs.
Run using a terminal, command line, or an IDE like VS Code/PyCharm.
Best for larger projects and production-ready code.
- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):**
    - An interactive environment that allows you to mix code, markdown, and visualizations.
Best for data analysis, quick prototyping, and educational purposes.
Supports inline plots (like matplotlib and seaborn).  

ðŸ‘‰ Recommendation: Use .py for software development and .ipynb for analysis, documentation, or interactive work.

## Can BuildingLogiX help me develop in Python?
Yes, BuildingLogiX has in-house developers and engineers who are happy to assist. IF you want to collarborate on BDXpy development it is considered custom development and involves working directly with our team! We will also likely have a series of small training seminars annual on BDXpy.
Reach out to us if you are interested.
